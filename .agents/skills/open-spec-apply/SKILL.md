Implement tasks from a working change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one directory exists under `specs/changes/`
   - If ambiguous, inspect available directories under `specs/changes/` and ask the user to choose

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `open-spec-apply <other>`).

2. **Read the change artifacts**

   Read the files that exist under `specs/changes/<name>/`:

   - `proposal.md`
   - `design.md`
   - `tasks.md`

   If `tasks.md` is missing, pause and ask whether to create it first with the `open-spec-propose` skill.

3. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Change being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview

4. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

5. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest using the `open-spec-complete` skill to sync `specs/features/`
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name>

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

All tasks complete! Use the `open-spec-complete` skill to sync `specs/features/` and clean up workflow artifacts.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read the available change artifacts before starting
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Treat `specs/changes/` as working state only; completion still requires syncing `specs/features/`

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
